This project focuses on developing a predictive model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect Parkinson's Disease (PD) from brain X-ray images.
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and motor functions. Early detection through brain imaging can greatly help in managing and treating the disease. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict the onset of Parkinson's Disease from brain X-ray images. The deep learning model focuses on identifying patterns and abnormalities within the X-ray images that are indicative of PD.
The dataset for this project consists of brain X-ray images. Each image is labeled to indicate whether it belongs to a person diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease or not. 
There are :
5 Convolutional layers
5 Max Pooling layers
1 Fully connected layer (1024 units)
1 Fully connected output layer (2 units for binary classification)
This architecture defines a relatively deep network for image classification, specifically for detecting Parkinson's Disease using brain X-ray images.
